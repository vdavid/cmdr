This folder contains notes that are not specs, ADRs, or docs on the system. This is pretty much a catch-all folder for
docs that feel helpful and important for some time, but don't belong anywhere else.
Like specs, this folder gets wiped periodically once we made sure that all important information like intent behind
features and processes is captured somewhere else (code or docs).
