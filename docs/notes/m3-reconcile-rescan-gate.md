# M3.0 gate — non-destructive reconcile rescan (perf + correctness)

Status: gate complete. Recommendation: **GO**, full (reconcile for all volume kinds), with one mandatory design
constraint (single bottom-up coverage recompute, not per-dir propagation). Measured 2026-06-25 on the
`index-reconcile-rescan` worktree.

Throwaway gate artifacts (review, then delete or promote): `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/indexing/reconcile_bench.rs`
(perf, `#[ignore]`d), `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/indexing/reconcile_correctness.rs` (correctness, runs in CI). Wired in
`indexing/mod.rs`.

## TL;DR

- **Correctness is achievable cleanly.** The existing `reconcile_subtree` already does the exhaustive per-dir diff
  (add/remove/modify/dir↔file type-change) and already stamps `listed_epoch` + propagates `min_subtree_epoch` (M1/M2
  landed it). A complete reconcile deletes vanished children itself, so an interrupted→complete cycle self-heals: no
  orphans, no ghost sizes, across repeated cycles. The reconciled index matches a fresh-from-scratch index byte-for-byte
  on sizes/counts/membership. **No extra orphan-sweep mechanism is required for correctness** when a complete reconcile
  runs; a prototype epoch sweep is included as an optional belt-and-suspenders.
- **Perf is acceptable — IF the coverage recompute is done right.** Firing `PropagateMinSubtreeEpoch` once per dir (37k
  ancestor-walks) is the dominant cost and makes a no-op reconcile ~2× SLOWER than today's truncate baseline. Replacing
  it with ONE bottom-up aggregate after the walk makes a no-op reconcile CHEAPER than the truncate baseline.

## A. Performance

Bench measures the DB write-path delta only (the FS/network walk is unchanged from today's scan and is the same across
all strategies, so it's excluded — we drive the real writer with each strategy's exact message stream). Synthetic tree:
**486,836 entries / 37,449 dirs** (≈ local `root` entry scale; ~37k dirs extrapolates ×~14 to the doc's ~538k-dir figure
— costs below are O(dirs)/O(entries) linear, so scale them by ~14 for full `root`).

Release build, representative run (run-to-run varies with machine load; the _ranking_ is stable):

| Strategy                                                        | Time          | vs baseline            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Baseline: truncate + bulk reinsert + `ComputeAllAggregates`     | ~910–1900 ms  | 1.0×                   |
| Reconcile no-op, **per-dir `PropagateMinSubtreeEpoch`** (naive) | ~1950–2600 ms | ~2× SLOWER             |
| Reconcile no-op, **single bottom-up aggregate** (recommended)   | ~720–1070 ms  | **~0.6–0.8× (faster)** |
| Reconcile 1%-changed (375 dirs)                                 | ~1200–2600 ms | ~1.3×                  |

No-op phase breakdown (release): per-dir DB read+name-diff ≈ 350 ms, `MarkDirsListed` ≈ 40–55 ms (cheap, PK-keyed UPDATE
as designed), **per-dir propagate ≈ 1550–2200 ms** (the killer), single aggregate ≈ 370–550 ms.

Why per-dir propagate is so costly: `propagate_min_subtree_epoch` walks the ancestor chain doing `recompute` +
`get_parent_id` queries per hop, with a short-circuit only once a value stabilizes. After a _full_ reconcile that
re-stamps every dir to the same new epoch, nothing stabilizes early on the first deep walks, so it degenerates toward
O(dirs × depth) round trips. A single bottom-up pass (`compute_all_aggregates_reported`, the SQL fallback
`ComputeAllAggregates` already takes when accumulator maps are empty) recomputes the whole coverage rollup in O(dirs)
with two bulk loads — and is verified to re-stamp coverage to the new epoch correctly (assertion in the bench).

Key gate property holds: **a no-op reconcile writes ZERO entry rows** (asserted), so it never touches the catastrophic
`INSERT OR REPLACE` / `platform_case` path. The 1%-changed arm writes only the changed rows + their delta propagation.
Neither arm re-UPSERTs unchanged rows (the failure mode the gate worried about). `UpsertEntryV2` does always issue an
`UPDATE` for a matched row, but `reconcile_subtree` only sends `UpsertEntryV2` when `changed` is true, so unchanged rows
are never written.

Extrapolation to full `root` (~538k dirs, ~5.5M entries): multiply by ~11–14. The recommended no-op reconcile stays at
or below the truncate baseline's order of magnitude; the absolute win is that it never blanks the index and never
regresses prior-complete data. (Debug-build numbers are ~3× higher across the board; use release figures.)

## B. Correctness

All in `reconcile_correctness.rs`, real `reconcile_subtree` against real on-disk temp trees + real store/writer:

1. `reconcile_handles_add_remove_modify_typechange` — add, remove, size+mtime modify, and dir→file type change all land;
   counts and `min_subtree_epoch` update; no orphans.
2. `partial_reconcile_keeps_a_fresh_b_stale` — after an epoch bump, reconciling only `/a` re-stamps `/a` to the current
   epoch while `/b` stays at the old epoch (stale). Proves partial-rescan granularity.
3. `deleted_dir_unreached_by_interrupted_reconcile_heals_on_next_complete` — the exact gate probe. A dir deleted on disk
   while a reconcile is interrupted before reaching it DOES linger after the interrupted pass (asserted hazard) and DOES
   drag the parent's coverage below the current epoch — then a later complete reconcile sweeps it and restores coverage.
4. `repeated_interrupted_then_complete_reconcile_leaves_no_orphans_or_ghosts` — 3 cycles of mutate (incl. deleting a
   whole subtree) → bump → interrupted reconcile → complete reconcile. After all cycles: no orphans, and the index
   matches a fresh-from-scratch build of the final disk state (no ghost sizes). This is the 1.83 TB-ghost-class guard as
   a standing test.
5. `prototype_epoch_orphan_sweep_prunes_only_gone_rows` — prototype of the optional epoch sweep (prune dirs whose
   `listed_epoch < rescan_epoch` AND whose parent was re-listed at `rescan_epoch`); prunes exactly the vanished dir,
   spares re-listed ones.

Why orphan-freedom holds without a mandatory sweep: a _complete_ reconcile re-lists every dir and its delete branch
(`for row in db_children { if !matched { Delete } }`) removes any child absent from the live listing — including the
whole subtree of a dir deleted while a prior pass was interrupted, because that dir is a direct child of _some_ dir the
complete pass re-lists. The interrupted state is transiently dirty (lingering rows, coverage shows incomplete = honest
"≥"/"—"), and the next complete pass is exhaustive.

The one residual: if a user is interrupted on EVERY rescan and never completes one, lingering rows persist (but coverage
honestly reads incomplete the whole time — no false "complete"). The optional epoch sweep (test 5) self-heals that
without waiting for the parent dir to be diffed again; recommend shipping it as cheap insurance, not as a correctness
prerequisite.

## Recommendation: full GO

Route the full rescan through reconcile for ALL volume kinds (local jwalk + SMB/MTP `volume_scanner`). The diff
machinery, epoch stamping, and coverage rollup already exist and are proven correct here. No local-vs-network split is
warranted — the perf concern was the coverage recompute strategy, not the volume kind.

### M3.1 design shape (blueprint)

- **Reuse `reconcile_subtree`'s per-dir diff** as the rescan body. For local, generalize it to drive from the jwalk walk
  (or keep BFS read_dir — the walk cost is I/O-bound and unchanged); for SMB/MTP, drive it from `volume_scanner`'s
  `Volume::list_directory` BFS instead of `std::fs::read_dir`. The diff/upsert/delete logic is identical.
- **Drop the up-front `TruncateData` for rescans.** Production truncate sites to change: `manager.rs:764` (local
  `start_scan`) and `manager.rs:380` (network `start_volume_scan`). Keep `TruncateData` ONLY for a true first scan (no
  existing index) and `clear_index` rebuild.
- **MANDATORY: do NOT propagate coverage per-dir on a full rescan.** After the walk, stamp all listed dirs
  (`MarkDirsListed`, already cheap) and run ONE `ComputeAllAggregates` (which with empty accumulator maps takes the
  O(dirs) bulk-SQL `compute_all_aggregates_reported` path and recomputes sizes + `min_subtree_epoch` correctly). This is
  the difference between ~2× slower and faster-than-baseline. Per-dir `PropagateMinSubtreeEpoch` stays only for the
  small-scope live verifier reconciles (where the chain is short), not the full rescan.
- **Epoch bump at rescan start** (continuity break) → whole tree reads stale-but-visible; each reconciled dir flips
  fresh as re-listed. The bump funnels already exist (`start_scan` / `start_volume_scan` per M2).
- **Keep `next_id` from the shared `Arc<AtomicI64>`** (reads `MAX(id)+1` on writer spawn; never reset for a rescan). IDs
  growing across rescans is harmless (i64).
- **Preserve the pre-arm-before-snapshot live-change buffering**, adapted: there's no truncate to race now, so a
  mid-rescan live change to an already-reconciled dir can be applied directly (or kept buffered + replayed; either is
  safe since the prior tree is intact). Simpler than today.
- **Optional orphan sweep** (prototype in test 5): run after a complete reconcile as cheap insurance for the
  never-completes-a-rescan user. Bounded, logged. Not required for correctness.

### What this buys

Mid-rescan disconnect leaves the prior complete data intact (no truncate to blank it) — the proper fix for M2's
session-scoped-partial limitation. A persisted index shows stale-but-whole across relaunch.
