# Source queue

Translators log English-side problems here while translating: ambiguous or inconsistent English, a weak `@key`
description, a missing screenshot, or a rule every language should follow. One bullet per item, at most two lines: the
key(s), what's wrong, the suggested fix. The lead fixes the English, the description, or the shared docs (promoting a
rule into `translation-principles.md` or `translator-instructions.md`), then deletes the entry; git keeps the history.
Process feedback (a translator's homemade scripts and workarounds) goes under its own heading at the end.

## Open

- Screenshots: `mtp-browse.png` doesn't show the `mtp.readiness.connecting` row, and the AI suggestions dialog keys ship
  without any (the pills and fact lines need them most). Needs a `pnpm i18n:shots` run with the Mac left alone. (all)
- Counted nouns in the RAW `errors.*` family can't take an ICU plural, so Slavic locales still need a colon form:
  `errors.write.trashRefused.message.*`, `errors.write.deviceDisconnected.sided.*`,
  `errors.eject.unmountRefusedByProcesses`. Either word around the count, or give the raw path a plural. (uk)
- `archive` concept: the zip-noun keys (`fileExplorer.list.rowKind.archive`, `suggestedOps.facts.archive`) now leave
  `archive-chat`, but `archive`'s own `notMatch` drops any value that's exactly "Archive", so they match neither. Needs
  a key-scoped `match`. (all)
- `menu.window.zoom` and `menu.view.zoom` are both "Zoom" in English, so cs, fr, and uk keep a `zoom` exception; split
  the English or accept it. Needs David: it renames a menu item. (uk)
- The `remove` / `original` concepts match `operationLog.tree.statusRemoved`, `skipReason.locked`, and
  `skipReason.restoreTargetOccupied`, which their own descriptions exclude. (cs, de, es, fr, hu, nl, pt, ru, sv, uk, vi,
  zh, zh-Hant)
- `operationLog.dialog.selectedCount` drives its plural with the TOTAL, but "selected" agrees with the checked count
  (`3 sur 12 sélectionnés`), so fr falls back to a colon form. Pass the checked count as the plural driver: a code
  change plus a new key, since translations agree with the old driver. Likewise `operationLog.tree.backfillProgress` has
  no plural driver at all for "Read {doneText} … items". (cs, es, fr, pt, sv)
- `search.coverage.line.uncovered.*`: `{drive}` is either a name or the generic phrase from
  `search.coverage.unnamedDrive`, so case-marking languages read stiffly ("ezt: ez a meghajtó"), and in `.unavailable`
  it actually holds a SERVER name. Give the generic case its own variant key, or a server param of its own. (hu, ru)
- `look-inside` is defined as the AI reading a file, yet `search.coverage.line.denied` / `.declined` use it for a walk
  entering folders: widen or exclude. (cs, ru)
- "system" (the OS, `search.coverage.line.offLimits`) has no concept yet, and every locale coined its own word; add one
  sourced from Apple's localized macOS. (sv, zh, zh-Hant, uk)
- vi: `search.coverage.deniedFullDiskAccess` and `search.coverage.setUpFullDiskAccess` say `quyền truy cập toàn bộ đĩa`,
  but Apple's pane is `Quyền truy cập đầy đủ vào ổ đĩa` (vi `style.md`). Re-translate both. (vi)
- "Couldn't X" sentences naming Cmdr as the subject (`search.coverage.line.failedRoots`) collide with a style guide's
  impersonal pattern ("X ließ sich nicht öffnen") because `dont-translate` demands "Cmdr". Decide whether an actor-only
  "Cmdr" may drop in translation. Needs David. (de)
- `pnpm i18n:brief`'s regional-overlay section names vocabulary forks only; `es-419` also forks the compound perfect to
  the preterite ("no pudo"), which cost a failed check. Name tense forks there. (es)
- Briefs for brand-new keys: run `sync-locale-keys.ts` before `pnpm i18n:brief`, or the brief describes skeletons the
  catalog doesn't hold yet. (cs, de, es, fr, nl, pt, sv)
- `ask` concept matched "Your settings ask for" (`settings.ai.provider.localUnavailable`), the request sense; added
  `settings ask for` to its `notMatch`. A broader "ask for" exclusion needs a call, since prose "asks for your password"
  sits in the concept. (all)
- `settings.fileExplorer.typeToJump.mode.description`: the `other` branch names the PC's Backspace key, but no concept
  covers it (`delete-key` is the Mac ⌫ key), so each locale records its PC key name ad hoc (es put `Retroceso` in
  `delete-key`'s `other` form). Propose a `backspace-key` concept. (es)
- `recent` matches "recently closed tabs" (`settings.fileExplorer.tabs.closedTabHistorySize.description*`), which vi
  renders as "just closed" (`vừa đóng`), as its `commands.handler.noRecentlyClosedTabs` already does under an exception.
  Only vi deviates, and the concept's sense names recently closed tabs, so it stays a vi exception unless another locale
  does the same. (vi)

## Process feedback

Translators log here every script they wrote and every workaround they needed (the report's Process feedback section,
`translator-instructions.md`): one bullet per item, the tool or step that was missing, and the locale. The lead reads it
after each wave. Two locales logging the same kind of script is a missing tool: build it or fix the brief, then delete
the entries (`docs/guides/multi-agent-refactors.md` § Fan-out sweeps).
