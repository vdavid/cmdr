This folder contains specification docs and task lists for developments.
They are not meant to describe any _state_ of the codebase or feature set, but are temporary docs to aid feature
development while it's going.
They are only kept for reference, similarly to the ADRs, but this folder gets wiped periodically once we made sure that
all important information like intent behind features and processes is captured somewhere else (code or docs).
