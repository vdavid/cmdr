# Network SMB support

Discover, browse, and mount SMB network shares. Works on macOS and Linux.

## Architecture

- **Discovery**: `mdns_discovery.rs` — Pure Rust mDNS using `mdns-sd` crate. Cross-platform.
- **E2E testing**: `virtual_smb_hosts.rs` — Injects synthetic `NetworkHost` entries for Docker SMB containers. Gated behind `smb-e2e` Cargo feature. Never enabled in production.
- **Share listing**: Split across multiple files:
  - `smb_client.rs` — Top-level share-listing entry point; orchestrates guest -> keychain -> prompt auth flow; tries smb-rs first, falls back to smbutil (macOS only)
  - `smb_connection.rs` — TCP connection establishment and IPC-level share listing calls
  - `smb_cache.rs` — 30-second in-memory cache for share lists, keyed by server address
  - `smb_smbutil.rs` — `smbutil view -G` fallback for older Samba/NAS servers (macOS); on Linux delegates to `smb_smbclient`
  - `smb_smbclient.rs` — `smbclient -L` fallback for Linux (requires `samba-client` package)
  - `linux_distro.rs` — Thin wrapper calling `crate::linux_distro::LinuxDistro` for smbclient install hints; `cfg(target_os = "linux")` gated
  - `smb_types.rs` — Shared types (`ShareInfo`, `AuthMode`, `ShareListError`, etc.)
  - `smb_util.rs` — Helpers: hostname derivation, IP resolution, account-name normalization
- **Mounting** (platform-specific via `#[path]` in `mod.rs`):
  - `mount.rs` — macOS `NetFSMountURLSync` for native `/Volumes/` mounts
  - `mount_linux.rs` — Linux `gio mount` for GVFS-based user-space mounts
- **Auth** (platform-specific via `#[path]` in `mod.rs`):
  - `keychain.rs` — macOS Keychain via `security-framework`
  - `keychain_linux.rs` — Two-tier: Secret Service via `keyring` crate → encrypted file via `cocoon` crate
- **State**: `known_shares.rs` — Connection history in `known-shares.json` (usernames, last auth mode, timestamps).

## Platform strategy

| Component | macOS | Linux |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| mDNS discovery | `mdns-sd` (pure Rust) | `mdns-sd` (same) |
| SMB share listing | `smb` + `smb-rpc` crates | `smb` + `smb-rpc` (same) |
| smbutil fallback | `smbutil view -G` | `smbclient -L` (from `samba-client` package) |
| Credential storage | `security-framework` (macOS Keychain) | `keyring` (Secret Service) → `cocoon` encrypted file fallback |
| Mounting | `NetFSMountURLSync` → `/Volumes/` | `gio mount` → `/run/user/<uid>/gvfs/` |

## Key decisions

### `NetFSMountURLAsync` for SMB mounting (not `mount_smbfs` CLI)

Non-blocking (UI stays responsive), credentials passed via secure API (not exposed in process list), native Keychain
integration, and structured error codes instead of parsing stderr. Requires custom Rust FFI bindings for NetFS.framework.
Linux uses `gio mount` (GVFS) instead.

### Custom auth UI with Keychain integration (not system dialog)

Full UX control (login form appears in-pane), smart defaults (pre-fill username from connection history), and
guest/credentials toggle. Uses `security-framework` crate for Keychain access. Passwords never stored in our settings
file — only in Keychain. Linux uses `keyring` crate (Secret Service) with encrypted file fallback.

### `smb-rs` for SMB share enumeration (not `pavao`/libsmbclient or `smbutil`)

MIT license (compatible with BSL, allows dual-licensing for enterprise), pure Rust (no C dependencies), async-native
(built on tokio), and cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). `pavao` (libsmbclient wrapper) was rejected for its GPLv3
license. `smbutil` CLI was rejected for fragile text parsing and process spawning. Fallback to `smbutil`/`smbclient` is
available for older Samba servers where smb-rs's RPC fails.

### Always use IP when available

smb-rs doesn't resolve `.local` hostnames reliably (std lib DNS doesn't handle mDNS). Always pass resolved IP from mDNS discovery. If IP unavailable, use derived hostname (`service_name_to_hostname`).

### Guest-first auth flow

1. Try anonymous/guest access first
2. On auth error → check stored credentials
3. If no stored creds → prompt user
4. Never assume "guest only" — always offer "Sign in for more access" when guest succeeds (can't distinguish guest-only from guest-or-creds at probe time)

### smbutil / smbclient fallback

`smb` crate fails on older Samba servers (for example, Raspberry Pi) with RPC incompatibility. Classify error as `ProtocolError`, then try a platform-specific CLI fallback:
- **macOS:** `smbutil view -G` (built-in).
- **Linux:** `smbclient -L` (from `samba-client` package). If `smbclient` is not installed, returns a `MissingDependency` error with a distro-specific install command (detected via `/etc/os-release`). The `smb_smbutil.rs` Linux stubs delegate to `smb_smbclient.rs`.
- **Other platforms:** stubs return `ProtocolError`.

### No persistent connection pool

smb-rs connections are lightweight and created on-demand. Caching is at the share list level (30s TTL), not TCP connection level.

### In-memory credential cache

After first credential fetch, credentials cached in `CREDENTIAL_CACHE` (LazyLock + RwLock). Prevents repeated Keychain/secret-service round-trips during session. Cache keyed by `"smb://{server}/{share}"`.

### Linux credential storage fallback

On Linux, `keychain_linux.rs` tries Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet) first. If unavailable (no D-Bus service, headless server, minimal DE), it falls back to an encrypted file at `~/.local/share/cmdr/credentials.enc`. The file is encrypted with `cocoon` (Chacha20-Poly1305) using `/etc/machine-id` as the password, with 0600 file permissions. A static `USING_FILE_FALLBACK` flag tracks whether the fallback is active for the frontend to show a one-time info toast. Corrupted credential files are handled gracefully (start fresh, log warning).

### Linux mounting via GVFS

`gio mount` is used for user-space SMB mounting on Linux. It requires the `gvfs-smb` package. If `gio` is not available, a helpful error message is returned. Mounts appear under `/run/user/<uid>/gvfs/`.

## Gotchas

- **Don't hold mutex during DNS resolution**: `get_host_for_resolution` / `update_host_resolution` extract host info and release the mutex before blocking DNS, then re-acquire to update. Holding the mutex across network calls risks deadlock.
- **Auth mode is a guess**: `GuestAllowed` means "guest worked, creds might also work." `CredsRequired` means "guest failed, must have creds." Can't detect guest-only vs guest-or-creds without trying both.
- **NetFS error 17 (EEXIST) is success** (macOS): Share already mounted. Return existing mount path, set `already_mounted: true`. Not an error.
- **mDNS service type must include `.local.`**: `mdns-sd` requires full form `"_smb._tcp.local."` (trailing dot). Without it, browse() fails silently.
- **Account name is lowercase**: `make_account_name` lowercases server name for consistency. Prevents duplicate entries for "SERVER" vs "server".
- **Linux `gio mount` requires GVFS**: The `gvfs-smb` package must be installed. Standard on Ubuntu/Fedora GNOME desktops. KDE desktops may need it explicitly.
- **`ShareListError` uses internally tagged serde format** (`#[serde(tag = "type")]`) with struct variants. This keeps a flat JSON shape (`{ "type": "protocol_error", "message": "..." }`). The `MissingDependency` variant adds an optional `installCommand` field. When adding new variants, use struct syntax (not tuple).
- **macOS smbutil and NetFSMountURLSync fail with loopback IP + non-standard port**: `//127.0.0.1:9445` gives "Broken pipe", but `//localhost:9445` works. `build_smbutil_url` and `NetworkMountView.svelte` both fall back to hostname when IP is `127.0.0.1` or `::1`. This matters for E2E testing against Docker containers on localhost.
- **Mount URL must include port when non-standard**: `NetworkMountView.svelte` appends `:PORT` to the server string when `port !== 445`. Without this, `NetFSMountURLSync` defaults to port 445 and can't reach Docker containers on custom ports.
