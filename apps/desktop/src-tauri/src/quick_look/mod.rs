//! Native macOS Quick Look panel integration.
//!
//! Owns a single `QuickLookController` registered as `tauri::State`. The controller
//! implements `QLPreviewPanelDataSource` and `QLPreviewPanelDelegate`, opens the
//! process-wide shared `QLPreviewPanel`, and emits two Tauri events:
//!
//! - `quick-look-key` — keyboard events the panel didn't want (we re-dispatch on
//!   the focused pane so arrow keys / Shift+Space still work while the panel is key)
//! - `quick-look-closed` — fires whenever the panel actually leaves the screen
//!   (✕, Esc, or our own `orderOut:`). Frontend uses it to flip `isOpen = false`.
//!
//! Three Tauri commands gate the controller from the frontend: `quick_look_open`,
//! `quick_look_set_path`, `quick_look_close`. All three hop to the AppKit main
//! thread via `app.run_on_main_thread()` + a one-shot `mpsc` channel (panel calls
//! have main-thread affinity), and the IPC layer wraps the await in a 2 s timeout
//! so a wedged AppKit pump never freezes the IPC pool.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/quick-look-plan.md` § "Why a singleton controller" for the
//! design rationale.
