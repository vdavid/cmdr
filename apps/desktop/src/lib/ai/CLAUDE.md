# AI features (frontend)

UI and state for AI-powered features (local LLM or OpenAI-compatible). Backend: `src-tauri/src/ai/` (download,
llama-server process, inference client with provider routing).

## Architecture

- **State**: `ai-state.svelte.ts` — Reactive AI status, download progress, Tauri event listeners
- **Toast wiring**: `ai-toast-sync.svelte.ts` — Reactively syncs state to toast via `$effect`
- **Toast content**: `AiToastContent.svelte` — Install flow UI (offer → downloading → installing → ready)
- **Backend**: See `src-tauri/src/ai/` for model download, llama-server lifecycle, inference client

`ai-state.svelte.ts` manages state and exports handlers. `ai-toast-sync.svelte.ts` uses a `$effect` to reactively watch
`aiState.notificationState` and sync the toast — no manual notification needed after state mutations.
`AiToastContent.svelte` imports `getAiState` and handlers directly from `ai-state.svelte.ts`. No circular dependency
because `ai-state.svelte.ts` never imports from `ai-toast-sync.svelte.ts` or `AiToastContent.svelte`. `initAiState()`
and `initAiToastSync()` are both called from `+layout.svelte`.

## Key decisions

### Apple Silicon only (local LLM)

Local LLM requires Apple Silicon. Intel Macs can use OpenAI-compatible provider. The "Local LLM" toggle is disabled on
Intel Macs with an explanatory tooltip (controlled by `AiRuntimeStatus.localAiSupported`).

### AI settings in registry

Settings `ai.provider`, `ai.openaiApiKey`, `ai.openaiBaseUrl`, `ai.openaiModel`, `ai.localContextSize` are defined in
`settings-registry.ts`. The main layout calls `configureAi(...)` after `initSettingsApplier()` to push config to
backend.

### 7-day dismissal, permanent opt-out

"Not now" hides offer for 7 days (`dismissedUntil` timestamp in state). "I don't want AI" sets `opted_out: true`
(permanent). Re-enable via Settings.

### Model registry is extensible

`AVAILABLE_MODELS` constant in backend (`src-tauri/src/ai/mod.rs`) defines available models. Current default: Ministral
3B (~2.0 GB). Falcon H1R 7B still in registry as fallback.

### Folder suggestions: 10s timeout, graceful failure

When opening "New folder" dialog, calls `getFolderSuggestions()`. If LLM doesn't respond in 10s, returns empty array. UI
hides suggestions section (no error shown). Feature degrades gracefully.

### Download resumption via HTTP Range

Model download supports HTTP Range header for resume after interruption. No SHA256 verification (HuggingFace doesn't
provide checksums) — file size check only.

## Gotchas

- **Status transitions are frontend-driven**: Backend emits `ai-download-progress` and `ai-install-complete` events.
  Frontend interprets these to update `aiStatus`. Backend has no "status" concept — just `AiState` (installed/port/pid).
- **llama-server is NOT auto-restarted**: Health monitoring (periodic restart on crash) is deferred. If server crashes,
  it stays down until app restart. User sees "AI unavailable."
- **Model switch requires app restart**: Changing selected model in Settings requires download + restart. No hot-swap.
- **`opted_out` flag is legacy**: The `opted_out` field in `AiState` is superseded by `ai.provider` setting. It remains
  in the struct but is no longer checked. `ai.provider` in the frontend settings store is the source of truth.

## Development

**Run with mock license**:

```bash
CMDR_MOCK_LICENSE=commercial pnpm tauri dev
```

**Test with AI debug logging**:

```bash
pnpm dev:ai-debug
```

**llama-server update**: See `apps/desktop/scripts/download-llama-server.go` (version + SHA256). Binaries are extracted
and signed at build time, bundled as individual files in `resources/ai/`. **Model registry**: See
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/ai/mod.rs` (`AVAILABLE_MODELS`) **Attribution**: Ministral 3B by Mistral AI (Apache 2.0),
