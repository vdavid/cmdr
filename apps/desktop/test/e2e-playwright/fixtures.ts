/**
 * Playwright test fixtures for Cmdr E2E testing.
 *
 * Uses tauri-playwright in Tauri mode: the test runner communicates with
 * the real Tauri app via a Unix socket, and commands are injected directly
 * into the webview via `webview.eval()`. No WebDriver, no HTTP server.
 *
 * Fixture lifecycle:
 * - globalSetup: creates the fixture directory tree (~170 MB)
 * - beforeEach: recreates small text files (keeps bulk .dat files)
 * - globalTeardown: deletes the fixture directory
