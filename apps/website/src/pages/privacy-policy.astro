    <p>
        Your privacy matters to us a lot. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we protect it.
        We've tried our best to keep it readable so you don't need lawyers to read it.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
            <strong>The short version:</strong> We collect minimal data. The website uses analytics and collects your email
            if you subscribe. The app periodically validates your license with our servers. We don't sell your data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Rymdskottkärra AB</strong> (the "data controller") is responsible for your personal data. We're a Swedish
        company located at Vattmyragränd 47, 177 39 Järfälla, Sweden. Few people know that the company name actually
        means "Space wheelbarrow".
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>

    <h3>On the website (getcmdr.com)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Email address</strong>: if you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics</strong>: we use PostHog to understand how visitors use our website. This includes pages
            visited, referrer, browser type, and approximate location (country level). PostHog may set cookies for this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Payment info</strong>: if you buy a license, payment is handled by Paddle. We see your
            email address and purchase details, but never your credit card number—that'd be too much risk for us.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>In the desktop app</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>License key</strong>: stored locally on your machine. The apps verifies it cryptographically offline,
            then we also periodically check on our servers whether it has expired or got extended.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Organization name</strong>: for commercial licenses, we store the organization name you provide at
            checkout, to display it in the app's About window.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics</strong>: aggregate usage statistics, _without_ any PII or user content. Think: "How many
            people used the network features last month?" (but never "Who used network features")
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What we don't collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your file names, contents, or any data from your file system, ever. We don't want to know your files.</li>
        <li>Your prompts, the AI's answers, tool calls, etc. The communication is all private between you and your AI,
            unless you use a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) that have different terms. But with Cmdr, you always
            have the option to keep ALL communications private with a local model.</li>
        <li>Your keystrokes, screenshots, clicks from the app.</li>
        <li>Your PII, personal files and documents.</li>
        <li>And we never train models on your data!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why we collect this data (legal basis)</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR (EU law to protect your rights over your data), we need a legal basis for processing your data, which
        is pretty nice and fair and we apply it to all our users globally, not just EU citizens. Here is a list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>License validation and subscription status checks</strong>: As a business baseline, we need to know
            who has a valid license and who doesn't.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interest</strong>: Analytics to understand how people use our app and website, what
            features they use, what new features might help them (this affects the roadmap!), and generally improve the
            website and product. It is very strictly _not_ about tracking any particular user (which we actually _avoid_
            at all costs), but only aggregate data that can't even be traced back to a single user.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Consent</strong>: Email addresses to send you news that hopefully interest you. (You can unsubscribe
            anytime from all communications we send, except for stuff we _need_ to send like updates to this very policy.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How we use your data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To process your license purchase</li>
        <li>To maintain and improve Cmdr</li>
        <li>To send you product updates (if you subscribed)</li>
        <li>To respond to your support requests</li>
        <li>To analyze website traffic and improve our communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Who we share data with</h2>
    <p>We only share data with service providers who help us operate Cmdr:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Paddle</strong> (payments) — processes purchases, handles taxes and invoicing. Based in the UK with
            GDPR-compliant processing.

            >

            >
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We don't sell your data. We don't share it with advertisers or anyone not listed above.</p>

    <h2>6. Where we store your data</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is processed and stored in the cloud without any specific geographical boundaries. Our license server
        runs on Cloudflare Workers on a global CDN. PostHog and Paddle are GDPR-compliant and have appropriate data
        processing agreements in place.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How long we keep your data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Purchase records</strong> — kept for 7 years (Swedish accounting law requirement)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Email subscriptions</strong> — until you unsubscribe, then we have no use for it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics data</strong> — typically 2 years, then aggregated further, or deleted. Old data is less helpful.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use cookies for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            cookies.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We don't use third-party advertising cookies or cross-site tracking.</p>
    <p>
        You can disable cookies in your browser settings. The website will still work, but we won't be able to improve
        our service based on your usage data.
    </p>
