    <p>
        Welcome to Cmdr! These terms govern your use of Cmdr, the desktop file manager application. By downloading,

        <p>
            <strong>The short version:</strong> Cmdr is source-available under the Business Source License (BSL 1.1).
            It's free forever for personal use. Commercial use requires a paid license ($59/year or $149 perpetual).
            The source code converts to AGPL-3.0 after 3 years. Be nice, and we'll all get along great.

    <h3>Source-available code</h3>
    <p>
        Cmdr's source code is licensed under the
        <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Source License 1.1 (BSL)</a

    </ul>

        <li>You're the only person using your installation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        You may evaluate Cmdr for commercial use for up to 14 days before purchasing a license.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What the license grants you</h2>
    <p>When you purchase a Cmdr license, you receive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A personal, non-transferable license to use Cmdr commercially</li>
        <li>The right to install Cmdr on unlimited machines you own (as long as you're the only user)</li>
        <li>All future updates at no additional cost</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share your license key with others or use it on behalf of multiple people</li>
        <li>Redistribute the official signed Cmdr binary commercially or claim it as your own product</li>
        <li>Circumvent or tamper with the licensing system in the official binary</li>
        <li>Use Cmdr for any illegal activities</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse engineer our license key signing infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These restrictions exist to protect the sustainability of the project. We're a small team, and license revenue
        keeps Cmdr alive.
    </p>
